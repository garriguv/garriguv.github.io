### What I do

I'm currently an engineering manager, but I love programming and designing
large systems.

I believe that programming languages are tools, and I enjoy learning new ones
and applying what I have learned to solve new challenges. I have worked
extensively with the following:

* Go
* Swift
* Scala
* Objective-C
* Ruby
