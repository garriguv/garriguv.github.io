title: How to set up Mjolnir for window management
description: A step-by-step guide to add window management.
---

After updating my mac to El Capitan, I was about to re-install my habitual window manager ([Divvy]), but because it's Sunday, and the grass is always greener elsewhere, I started looking for an alternative.

The usual suspect showed up: [Moom]. I used it before but as with [Divvy], there was something I didn't quite like with it.

But then I stumbled on a gem: [Mjolnir].

> Mjolnir is an OS X app that lets you automate common tasks using the language Lua.

So, yeah. Something even less user friendly than a regular window manager, but I haven't done any Lua yet and I can sync the config across multiple machines: SOLD. To top it off, the logo is awesome.

### How to make Mjolnir resize your windows

First, install [Mjolnir] and enable accessibility:

Let's install [Lua] and [LuaRocks] (The Lua package manager), we'll use homebrew for this:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install lua
```

Then we need to install a few modules:

```
$ luarocks install mjolnir.hotkey
$ luarocks install mjolnir.application
$ luarocks install mjolnir.bg.grid
```

You can find the entire list of modules here: [http://rocks.moonscript.org/search?q=mjolnir](http://rocks.moonscript.org/search?q=mjolnir)

Now the fun starts, let's create `~/.mjolnir/init.lua` and add a few window resize shortcuts:

While writing the scripts, use the Mjolnir console to reload the file. Just type `mjolnir.reload()`:

You can install [Mjolnir]'s documentation in [Dash]. Just search for it in the _User contributed_ section.

The above script is very basic and there's a lot of repetition. Since we're basically using a grid based layout, there's already a module for that: [mjolnir.bg.grid](http://luarocks.org/modules/briangilbert/mjolnir.bg.grid)

The program then becomes simpler and shorter:

{% gist garriguv/ab65283e6b68bc88185e %}

Happy scripting!
