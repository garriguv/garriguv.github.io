### What I do

Although I manage managers and individual contributors in my day-to-day job, I still love programming. I find my fun
in creating internal tools like CLIs and websites to help my teams.

I believe that programming languages are tools, and I enjoy learning new ones
and applying what I have learned to solve new challenges. I have worked
extensively with the following:

* Go
* Swift
* Scala
* Objective-C
* Ruby
