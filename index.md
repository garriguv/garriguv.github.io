### What I do

At Dance, I do a bit of everything: backend systems, mobile apps, macOS apps, firmware prototyping, data processing, etc. Making sure that the team is building the right things for our business.

I believe that programming languages are tools, and I enjoy learning new ones and applying what I have learned to solve new challenges. I have worked extensively with the following:

- TypeScript
- Swift
- Go
- Scala
- Objective-C
- Ruby
